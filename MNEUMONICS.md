# Mneumonics
This is a list of mneumonics of both vim commands that I find kind of hard to memorise as well as default and custom key mappings from or for my plugins

## Vim:
- **J**oin lines;
- **H** (top screen);
- **L** (bottom screen);
- **K** (man page identifier[disable it, very distracting]);
- **t**owards (like **f** but with a **h** right after);
- **c**hange **i**nner **w**ord;
- **d**elete **a**s **s**entence;
- **d**elete **a** **p**aragraph;

## Surround:
- **c**hange **s**urrounding **'** **(**;
  * where: **'** is the character to be changed and **(** is the character to change to
- **y**ield **s**urrounding **i**nner **w** **]**;
